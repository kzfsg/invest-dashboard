<p>The NFCI decreased to –0.51 in the week ending June 6. Risk indicators contributed –0.22, credit indicators contributed –0.17, and leverage indicators contributed –0.12 to the index in the latest week.</p>
<p>The ANFCI also decreased in the latest week, to –0.48. Risk indicators contributed –0.26, credit indicators contributed –0.16, leverage indicators contributed –0.09, and the adjustments for prevailing macroeconomic conditions contributed 0.04 to the index in the latest week.</p>
<p>The NFCI and ANFCI are each constructed to have an average value of zero and a standard deviation of one over a sample period extending back to 1971. Positive values of the NFCI have been historically associated with tighter-than-average financial conditions, while negative values have been historically associated with looser-than-average financial conditions. Similarly, positive values of the ANFCI have been historically associated with financial conditions that are tighter than what would be typically suggested by prevailing macroeconomic conditions, while negative values have been historically associated with the opposite.</p>
